		<center><img src="eleph.jpg"></center>
		<center><h4>The elephant is a mammal that is the largest of the terrestrial animals currently in existence. It is a herbivore, with a gestation period of 645 days, and is divided into two types: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. The African elephant is characterized by large ears and concave backs, while the Asian elephant is characterized by small ears and convex or flat backs. Elephants include extinct species also such as mammoths and mastics.
Elephants use their long proboscis for many purposes and their incisors grow into tusks and use them as tools to move things, dig and as a weapon, as well as the elephants' flapping of their ears helps them control the change in their body temperature, and they communicate through vision, touch and sound.
Elephants live in different environments, for example savannahs, forests, deserts and swamps, and prefer to stay near water.
One of the dangers that threaten the Asian elephant is extinction due to the ivory trade.</h4></center>

There are many types of bats, and they are generally divided into two parts:
<br>1- Large bats “Megachiroptera”, known as fruiting bats, are found in tropical regions of Africa, Australia and India.<br>
2- Small bats" Microchiroptera", called insect bats, and they eat various foods, but they depend mainly on insects for their food.
Bats sleep with their hind legs and head down, and most of their species live in colonies that contain thousands to collect their waste beneath them, and this waste is used as a sky to fertilize crops and the presence of nitrogenous substances in it.

There are more than 30 species of Gazelles that live in the vast areas of North and East Africa and Asia. Some Gazelles live in the mountains, but most of them live in flat sandy lands.
Gazelle have large, black eyes, and males and females have smooth black horns. Including her two horns gradient rings around them. . Dear has two long, slender, and pointed ears and short tail And his hair is short and soft. The back of Thomson's gazelle is light brown in color, with dark brown stripes on the loin. The abdomen is a pure white color.

The body of the blue whale is long and slender, and it is colored in several gradient colors, it is bluish gray at the back and lighter in color on the underside.

Balaenoptera musculus has five different subspecies: musculus which lives in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans, intermedia, which lives in the Antarctic Ocean, brocade, also known as the pygmy blue whale, which lives in the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean, and a blue whale in the northern Indian Ocean. Indica, which lives in the northern Indian Ocean, and the Chilensis blue whale, which lives off the coast of Chile and the southeastern Pacific Ocean.
Blue whales' diet consists of small crustaceans known as eicosanes.

		<center><img src="11.jpg"></center>
		<center><h4>The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa,
<br>
 where it is present in 26 countries. Due to its widespread occurrence and stable population trend, 
 <br>
 it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996.[1] It is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
<br> 
 occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments
 <br>
 such as lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshlands.[2] Although capable of living in saline environments, 
 <br>
 this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes.
 <br>
 The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the Nile delta. 
 <br>
 On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11.5 and 16.4 ft) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg 
 <br>
 (500 to 1,650 lb).
 <br>
 [3][4][5] However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and weighing up to 1,089 kg (2,400 lb) have been recorded.
 <br>
 It is the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile in the world,
 <br>
 after the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus).[6][7] Sexual dimorphism is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller
 <br>
 than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armoured skin

		<center><img src="33.jpg" width="250"></center>
		<center><h4>Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except Antarctica,
 <br>
 as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards are more
 <br>
 closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos
 <br>
  a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.
 <br>
Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Others are legless, and have long snake-like bodies. 
<br>
Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males
<br>
 and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous,
 <br>
 often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.
 <br>
Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to 
<br>
sacrifice and regrow their tails.

		<center><img src="44.jpg"  width="500" ></center>
		<center><h4>Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes.[2] Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic,
<br>
 amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard
<br>
 ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow
 <br>
 bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one
 <br>
 functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have
 <br>
 evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution,
 <br>
 leading to many lineages of legless lizards.[3] Legless lizards resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have
 <br>
 eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae
 <br>
 Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands,
 <br>
 such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, and many small islands of the Atlantic
 <br>
 and central Pacific oceans.[4] Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. More than 20 families
 <br>
  are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,600 species.[5][6] They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm 
 <br>
 (4.1 in)-long Barbados thread snake[7] to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length.[8] The fossil species Titanoboa
 <br>
 cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.[9] Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards,
 <br>
 perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago.[10] The diversity of modern
 <br>
 snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event).
<br> 
 The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
 <br>
Most species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.
<br>
 Some possess venom potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by
 <br> 
 constriction.

		<center><h4>The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae which is the largest salmon and can grow 
<br> 
up to a meter in length. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into this ocean. Most populations of
<br>  
this fish species are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which
<br> 
 the adult fish seasonally move upstream again to spawn.[3] When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and
<br>  
 appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are "landlocked", spending their entire lives in freshwater.
<br>  
 Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous,
<br>  
 which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year -such individuals can grow to
 <br> 
 extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English:
 <br>  
 alevin, fry, parr and smolt. Atlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many
<br>  
 cultures and as such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. 
 <br> 
 It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted 
 <br> 
 the population in some areas, and as such the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to
 <br> 
 have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed,
 <br> 
 and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world, and although this is now a viable alternative to
 <br> 
 wild-caught fish it has also attracted criticism from environmentalists.</h4></center>

Many organisms belonging to this phylum have a calciferous shell. The bodies are generally very soft and are covered by the hard exoskeleton. They can be found in terrestrial regions as well as in the depths of the seas. You will be amazed to know that the size of the molluscans can range from 20 metres to one millimetre, with a few microscopic animals too. These animals continue to have an important role in the lives of humans.
They are a source of food as well as jewellery. The hard shells are used to make beautiful jewellery pieces. In some regions of the world, these are also raised as pets, even though it sounds bizarre. Pearls that are obtained from bivalves and gastropods are valuable as these pearls are lined with nacre. Natural pearls are formed when a small foreign object gets stuck in between the mantle and shell of the mollusc.

The number of named species is about 20,000, but it is probable that only a small proportion of the free-living forms have been identified. A great deal of research has been conducted on the parasitic forms because most of them have some medical, veterinary, or economic importance.
Characteristic Features of Nematode:

●	Tubular in appearance
●	Majority are microscopic while a few can be viewed with the naked eye.  However, Placentonema gigantissima, a nematode that infects sperm whales has been shown to grow up to 9 meters (30 ft) in length
●	Head and tail are not visually distinct
